## Cipher Vault 🔐 | C++ Cipher Implementations  

**Cipher Vault** is a collection of various cipher algorithms implemented in C++. It currently includes **Caesar Cipher** and **Multiplicative Cipher**, with more to come! 🚀  

### 📂 **Structure**  

- `plain.txt` → Input plaintext  
- `cipher.txt` → Encrypted output  
- `encryption.cpp` → Encryption logic  
- `decryption.cpp` → Decryption logic  

### 🔧 **Usage**  

Compile and run the encryption & decryption files to process text using different ciphers.  

### 🤝 **Contribute**  

PRs are welcome! If you have a new cipher implementation, feel free to contribute.
